This coding challenge is all about **understanding javascript and coding without the help of a library or tools**. It is very easy to get caught up in all of the trendy libraries and tools that allow you to build front end applications. However, by focusing on just a library, you are letting yourself be at the mercy of trends that constantly change. Instead, if you are able to understand the core concepts of javascript, then you aren't as influenced by trends and you can constantly adapt since the underlying language of the web doesn't change very often (these libraries are all written in Javascript afterall!) In this challenge, you are only allowed to use JavaScript to build a game!

## What is the Challenge?
Using this as an example (but don't copy the code or use jQuery): https://codepen.io/natewiley/pen/HBrbL, you have to build a matching game that has these features:
- Time elapsed until you complete the game (all cards revealed)
- Total Moves count before you complete the game
- Reset button to start the game over

Optional:
- High Score Leaderboard

This is how the game board should look like (but you can design it however you like):

## The Rules Are:

1. Use only HTML, CSS and Javascript create a web based matching game as shown above. Think about code efficiency, and readability of your code.
